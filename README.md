# wongds-titanic
Kaggle Titanic machine learning problem for TBDSC by Daniel Wong.

## File structure
### /Kaggle Data/
Dataset from [Kaggle][], along with associated files provided there.
### /Python/
Solution to the problem using Python, starting with the `myfirstforest.py` Python script written by AstroDave and provided in the Kaggle data files. The original script by AstroDave provided by Kaggle seems to be written for Python 2.7, and new Python projects should be written for Python 3+.
Currently, my solution resides within an iPython/Jupyter Notebook.

### /R/
Solution to the problem using R, following the [Datacamp][] tutorial.
